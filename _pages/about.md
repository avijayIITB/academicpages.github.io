I am a PhD research scholar in [Electrical Engineering](www.ee.iitb.ac.in), [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](www.iitb.ac.in). My research is related to Signal Processing, signal approximations and quantization for IoT applications. I am being advised by [Prof. Animesh Kumar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~animesh/)

Earlier, I completed my Masters in [Communication and Signal Processing](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~comgroup/) in 2013, and Bachelors in Electronics and Communication in 2011.
